#### System::setStreamBufferSize
Sets the internal buffersize for streams opened after this call.
Larger values will consume more memory (see remarks), whereas smaller values may cause buffer under-run/starvation/stuttering caused by large delays in disk access (ie netstream), or cpu usage in slow machines, or by trying to play too many streams at once.

Note this function does not affect streams created with FMOD_OPENUSER, as the buffer size is specified in System::createSound.
This function does not affect latency of playback. All streams are pre-buffered (unless opened with FMOD_OPENONLY), so they will always start immediately.
Seek and Play operations can sometimes cause a reflush of this buffer.

If FMOD_TIMEUNIT_RAWBYTES is used, the memory allocated is 2 * the size passed in, because fmod allocates a double buffer.

#### System::getChannel
Retrieves a handle to a channel by ID.

#### System::getChannelsPlaying
Retrieves the number of currently playing channels.

#### System::getFileUsage
Retrieves information about file reads by FMOD.

#### System::getDriver
Returns the currently selected driver number. Drivers are enumerated when selecting a driver with System::setDriver or other driver related functions such as System::getNumDrivers or System::getDriverInfo.

##### System::getDriverInfo
Retrieves identification information about a sound device specified by its index, and specific to the output mode set with System::setOutput.

#### System::createSoundGroup
Creates a sound group, which can store handles to multiple Sound pointers.
Once a SoundGroup is created, Sound::setSoundGroup is used to put a sound in a SoundGroup.

#### System::createStream
Opens a sound for streaming. This function is a helper function that is the same as System::createSound but has the FMOD_CREATESTREAM flag added internally.

Note that a stream only has 1 decode buffer and file handle, and therefore can only be played once. It cannot play multiple times at once because it cannot share a stream buffer if the stream is playing at different positions.

Open multiple streams to have them play concurrently.

#### System::getMasterChannelGroup
Retrieves a handle to the internal master channel group. This is the default channel group that all channels play on.
This channel group can be used to do things like set the master volume for all playing sounds. See the ChannelGroup API for more functionality.

#### System::getMasterSoundGroup
Retrieves the default sound group, where all sounds are placed when they are created.
