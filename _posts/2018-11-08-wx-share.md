Sets the internal buffersize for streams opened after this call.
Larger values will consume more memory (see remarks), whereas smaller values may cause buffer under-run/starvation/stuttering caused by large delays in disk access (ie netstream), or cpu usage in slow machines, or by trying to play too many streams at once.

Note this function does not affect streams created with FMOD_OPENUSER, as the buffer size is specified in System::createSound.
This function does not affect latency of playback. All streams are pre-buffered (unless opened with FMOD_OPENONLY), so they will always start immediately.
Seek and Play operations can sometimes cause a reflush of this buffer.

If FMOD_TIMEUNIT_RAWBYTES is used, the memory allocated is 2 * the size passed in, because fmod allocates a double buffer.
